## Quick Reference - Commands

### Session Start

## Workflow

### The Complete Cycle

```
1. START     -->  git checkout -b plan-N-description
       |
2. IMPLEMENT -->  Edit files, commit with [Plan #N] prefix
       |
3. VERIFY    -->  make test && make check
       |
4. SHIP      -->  make pr-ready && make pr && make finish BRANCH=X PR=N
```

### Commit Messages

```bash
[Plan #N] Description       # Links to plan
[Trivial] Fix typo          # For tiny changes (<20 lines)
```

---

## Key Rules

### Plans
- All significant work requires a plan in `docs/plans/NN_name.md`
- Use `[Trivial]` only for <20 lines, no src/ changes

### Process Awareness
- If you're doing something not covered by the meta-process (no pattern, no
  template, no convention), treat it as a signal:
  - Either the meta-process has a gap — record it in `meta-process/ISSUES.md`
  - Or you're deviating from process — stop and ask before continuing
- Don't silently invent new conventions. Make them explicit.

## Design Principles

1. **{{PRINCIPLE_1_NAME}}** - {{PRINCIPLE_1_DESC}}
2. **{{PRINCIPLE_2_NAME}}** - {{PRINCIPLE_2_DESC}}
3. **{{PRINCIPLE_3_NAME}}** - {{PRINCIPLE_3_DESC}}
