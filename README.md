# Meta-Process: AI-Assisted Development Framework

A portable framework for coordinating AI coding assistants (Claude Code, etc.) on shared codebases.

## What This Solves

When AI instances work on a codebase:
- **Drift** - AI forgets constraints mid-implementation
- **Cheating** - AI writes weak tests that pass but don't verify requirements
- **No traceability** - Can't answer "what tests cover this feature?"
- **Documentation rot** - Docs diverge from code over time
- **AI guessing** - AI assumes instead of investigating

## Core Idea

**Move human review upstream.** Humans can't review code at AI speed, but CAN:
- Review requirements in plain English (Given/When/Then)
- See green/red CI
- Approve specs before implementation

If you trust the spec (human-reviewed) and trust CI (automated), you can trust implementation (green = done) without reading code.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install into your project
./meta-process/install.sh /path/to/your/project

# 2. Configure what patterns to enable
vim meta-process.yaml

# 3. Start using
git checkout -b plan-N-description   # Create feature branch
# ... do work ...
make pr-ready && make pr             # Ship it
make finish BRANCH=X PR=N            # Merge + cleanup
```

## Patterns (Pick What You Need)

### Always Recommended (Low Overhead)
| Pattern | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| Plans | Track work with `[Plan #N]` commits |
| Git Hooks | Catch issues before CI |
| Doc-Code Coupling | Fail CI when docs drift from code |
| Question-Driven Planning | AI investigates before coding |

### Add When Needed (More Setup)
| Pattern | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| ADR Governance | Link architecture decisions to code |
| Mock Policy | Enforce real tests over mocked tests |
| Acceptance Gates | Lock specs before implementation |
| Uncertainty Tracking | Preserve context across sessions |

### Multi-CC Coordination (Opt-In Module)
| Pattern | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| Claims + Worktrees | Prevent parallel AI instances from conflicting |
| Inter-CC Messaging | Async communication between AI instances |

> **Most projects don't need the multi-CC module.** A branch-based workflow with one AI instance at a time is simpler and works well. See `patterns/worktree-coordination/README.md` if you need it.

## Configuration

All patterns are configured in `meta-process.yaml`:

```yaml
weight: medium  # minimal | light | medium | heavy

planning:
  question_driven_planning: advisory  # disabled | advisory | required
  uncertainty_tracking: advisory

enforcement:
  strict_doc_coupling: false  # true = soft couplings also block
```

See `templates/meta-process.yaml.example` for all options.

## Directory Structure (After Install)

```

## Portable vs. Project-Specific Scripts

The framework separates **portable** scripts from **project-specific** extensions:

| Directory | Purpose | When to Modify |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `meta-process/scripts/` | Baseline scripts that work in any project | Never (modify upstream) |
| `scripts/` | Project-specific scripts that extend the baseline | Add features specific to your project |

**When adopting meta-process:**
1. Copy `meta-process/` directory to your project
2. Create project-specific scripts in `scripts/` as needed
3. Project scripts can import from meta-process or replace them entirely

## Full Documentation

See `patterns/` directory for detailed documentation of each pattern:
- `patterns/01_README.md` - Pattern index (core + optional modules)
- `patterns/15_plan-workflow.md` - How plans work
- `patterns/13_acceptance-gate-driven-development.md` - Full acceptance gate system

## Customizing for Your Project

The patterns are generic but examples come from [agent_ecology2](https://github.com/BrianMills2718/agent_ecology2), the project where this framework was developed. When adopting, replace project-specific terms in pattern documentation:

| agent_ecology2 term | Replace with |
|----------------------|--------------|
| `scrip` | Your currency/points system (or remove) |
| `principal` | Your user/account concept |
| `artifact` | Your entity/object concept |
| `kernel` | Your core/engine module |
| `ledger` | Your transaction/state store |

## Origin

Emerged from the [agent_ecology](https://github.com/BrianMills2718/agent_ecology2) project while coordinating Claude Code instances.
