# Meta-Process Architecture Decision Records

ADRs for the meta-process patterns themselves, not the agent ecology system.

## Why Meta-Process ADRs?

The meta-process documentation (`docs/meta/`) defines reusable development patterns for AI-assisted projects. Like any architecture, these patterns involve decisions with tradeoffs that should be documented.

Without ADRs:
- Decisions get lost or forgotten
- Rationale isn't preserved
- Changes happen without clear reasoning
- New contributors don't understand why things are the way they are

## Scope

These ADRs cover decisions about:
- Terminology choices for the meta-process
- Process structure and hierarchy
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Documentation organization

They do NOT cover:
- Agent ecology system architecture (those are in `docs/adr/`)
- Implementation details of specific patterns

## ADR Index

| # | Title | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| [0001](0001-acceptance-gate-terminology.md) | Acceptance Gate Terminology | Accepted |
| [0002](0002-thin-slice-enforcement.md) | Thin-Slice Enforcement | Accepted |
| [0003](0003-plan-gate-hierarchy.md) | Plan-Gate Hierarchy | Accepted |
| [0004](0004-gate-yaml-is-documentation.md) | Gate YAML Is Documentation | Accepted |
| [0005](0005-hierarchical-context-compression.md) | Documentation Layers Are Hierarchical Context Compression | Accepted |

## Format

Meta-process ADRs follow the same format as system ADRs:

```markdown
# META-ADR-NNNN: Title

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```

## Portability

These ADRs travel with the meta-process patterns. When adopting the patterns for another project, the ADRs explain the reasoning behind process decisions.
